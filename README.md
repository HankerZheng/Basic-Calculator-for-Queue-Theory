# Basic Calculator for Queueing Theory
This repository implements the calculation for 2 types of queues in the Queue Theory, namely, the M/M/c Queue and the M/M/c/c Queue, based on Erlang-B model and Erlang-C model.

The `.py` files contain the efficient way to initialize the queue and some methods to get the performance of the queue.

The `.xlsm` file implements a simple calculator. Given several condition a queue should satisfies, find the minimum `capacity` of that queue needed.

The `.vba` file contains the source code(Embeded-Macro) for the `.xlsm` file.
